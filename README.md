Hello, I'm making whirlwing!
Use or contribute to it if you'd like!

# Win32
I've decided to use win32 for now, because I want to do more low-level stuff with rust and learn it better.
This project is more about learning and less about actual product.
For production I would probably choose libraries like winit and wgpu-hal or something, but right now I want to write some low-level code.
